        <h1>Doctor Serial Management System</h1>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Our proposal aims to develop a comprehensive Doctor Serial Management
          System to facilitate appointment scheduling, patient management, and
          payment processing for medical consultations. The system will be
          developed using modern web technologies, employing Next.js for the
          frontend and Express.js for the backend.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          The current process of scheduling doctor appointments and managing
          patient records is often inefficient and prone to errors. Patients
          face challenges in securing appointments, while doctors and
          administrative staff struggle with manual record-keeping and payment
          processing.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Solution Overview</h2>
        <p>
          We propose to build a web-based application that enables patients to
          book appointments online, view doctor schedules, and make payments
          seamlessly. The system will automate appointment scheduling, patient
          registration, and payment processing, providing a user-friendly
          interface for both patients and medical staff.
        </p>
